      <h2>About Minaye</h2>
      <p>
        Minaye knows what it's like to feel a yearning for something more. 
        Her journey, from a child dreaming of fashion to a certified life coach, 
        has been fueled by a deep empathy for the human experience. She understands 
        the desire to not just look good, but to feel good, inside and out.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why her online space beautifully blends organic, comfortable clothing 
        with heartfelt guidance for life design. It's an invitation to explore what 
        truly makes your heart sing and to intentionally create a life that aligns 
        with those whispers within.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let Minaye offer a hand as you design a life that feels authentic, 
        purposeful, and deeply your own.
